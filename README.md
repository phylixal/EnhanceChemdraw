# EnhanceChemdraw

I try to add more hotkey and functions for ChemBioDraw using Autohotkey.

## Hotkeys

`
  * F2,         open or close the Analysis Window.
  * F6,         convert selected structure to CAS number, only get the first one in synonyms
  * Ctrl+F6,    convert selected text to structure (CAS number, or names), only get the most matched one
  * Shift+F6    convert selected text to structure (CAS number, or names), get all the matched ones
`

## How does it work?

This simple script uses Wget to fetch chemical data from pubchem. Most can be done by [PUG_REST](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug_rest/PUG_REST_Tutorial.html) web api.
